Education
======
* M.S. in Plant Breeding and Genetics, Wageningen University & Research, 2018
* M.S. in Bioinformatics, Saarland University, 2022
* Ph.D in Metagenomics, Saarland University & Helmholtz Institute of Pharmaceutical Research Saarland, 2025 (expected)

Work experience
======
* June 2020 - 2025 (expected): Ph.D in Bioinformatics
  * Saarland University & Helmholtz Institute of Pharmaceutical Research Saarland
  * Duties included: Research in Metagenomics. My project aims to develop a novel therapeutic approach to treat infections of the lung by the rational application of therapeutic microorganisms as living materials. Bioinformatic analysis of metagenomic data of patients with lung disease and health is used to identify beneficial commensal bacterial and resistance mechanisms of pathogens.
  * Supervisors: [Prof. Olga Kalinina](https://www.helmholtz-hips.de/en/research/people/person/prof-dr-olga-kalinina/), [Drug Bioinformatics (WIBI)](https://www.helmholtz-hips.de/en/research/teams/team/drug-bioinformatics/); [Prof. Dr. med.
